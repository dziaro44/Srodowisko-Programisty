# Student C Programming Tasks 📚💻

This project was created during my studies as a set of tasks for other students to help them get familiar with basic concepts of processes in Linux. It's a great way for students to see how these system-level concepts work for application developers while learning C. 🖥️

The project includes four tasks:

1. **File Tree** 🌳: Create directories, files, and symbolic links in a directory tree structure.
2. **Fork Tree** 🌲: Create a binary process tree by forking processes.
3. **Parameters** 🔢: Calculate the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers based on command-line parameters.
4. **Pipe** 🧑‍💻: Set up a pipe between two child processes and execute commands passed as arguments.

Each task comes with:
- Task descriptions 📄
- Example solutions 💡
- Sometimes additional helpful files like input/output examples or test scripts 🧪

The project was recently minimally refactored and translated into English. 🌍
